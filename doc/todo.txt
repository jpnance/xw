* Rebuses
	* Input syntax: "in[deli]ble" will input "IN*BLE"
	* Elsewhere on the screen, "* DELI" should be displayed
	* We'll need support for several other characters; it might be easiest to use numerals
	* Ideally, we'd be able to reuse rebuses (this might be required by the PUZ format)
* Inline jumps, e.g. "maori/4d" will input "MAORI" for the current clue and jump to 4D
* Mark a square as "unsure", e.g. "s?agat" will input "SAGAT" but color the S differently so as to visually suggest returning to it later
* "Downs only" mode
* "Gridless" mode
* Reveal answers
